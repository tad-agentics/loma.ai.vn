# Privacy Policy — Loma

**Last updated:** February 16, 2026

Loma ("we", "our", "us") operates the Loma Chrome extension and API service. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights.

## 1. What We Collect

### 1.1 Text You Submit
When you use Loma to rewrite text, we send your input text to our server for processing. We store:
- The input text and rewritten output
- Detected intent and language metadata
- Platform context (e.g., "gmail", "slack")
- Timestamp and response time

We use this data to improve our rewriting quality and intent detection.

### 1.2 Account Information
If you create an account (via Google Sign-in), we store:
- Your email address
- Authentication provider
- Subscription tier and usage counts

### 1.3 Usage Analytics
We collect anonymized usage events:
- Rewrite count, tone changes, intent selections
- Error events
- Platform distribution

We do **not** collect browsing history, page content beyond text fields you actively submit, or any data from pages where you do not use Loma.

## 2. How We Use Your Data

- **Provide the service:** Process your rewrite requests via our API
- **Improve quality:** Analyze rewrite patterns to improve intent detection and output quality
- **Enforce limits:** Track usage for free tier and billing

- **Supabase:** Our database provider, for storing user accounts and rewrite history.
- **Stripe / PayOS:** For processing payments (billing data only, not your text).

## 4. Data Retention
