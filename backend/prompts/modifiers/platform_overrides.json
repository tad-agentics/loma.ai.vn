  "platforms": {
    "slack": "PLATFORM: Slack message.\n\nADJUST:\n- Maximum 3 sentences. Slack messages are short.\n- No greeting or sign-off unless the user included one.\n- No paragraph breaks unless the message has distinct sections.\n- Contractions are fine ('I'll', 'can't', 'won't').\n- Emoji in the original can be preserved if contextually appropriate.",
    "gmail": "PLATFORM: Email (Gmail).\n\nADJUST:\n- Include a greeting line if the user's input implies one (e.g., starts with 'Anh ơi' or a name). Otherwise, no greeting.\n- Include a sign-off only if the input seems like a complete email (not a reply fragment).\n- Paragraphs are acceptable for complex messages.\n- Maximum 8 sentences for the body.",
    "outlook": "PLATFORM: Email (Outlook).\n\nADJUST:\n- Same conventions as email: greeting if the input implies one, sign-off if it's a complete email.\n- Paragraphs are acceptable for complex messages.\n- Maximum 8 sentences for the body.\n- Outlook users tend toward slightly more formal conventions — default to full sentences, avoid contractions in formal context.",
    "teams": "PLATFORM: Microsoft Teams message.\n\nADJUST:\n- Maximum 3 sentences. Teams messages are chat-like, similar to Slack.\n- No greeting or sign-off unless the user included one.\n- No paragraph breaks unless the message has distinct sections.\n- Contractions are fine ('I'll', 'can't', 'won't').\n- If this is a channel post (longer form), allow up to 5 sentences.\n- Emoji in the original can be preserved if contextually appropriate.",
    "google_docs": "PLATFORM: Google Docs (document or comment).\n\nADJUST:\n- If this looks like a document draft (paragraphs, sections), preserve the structure and rewrite in place.\n- If this looks like a comment, keep it concise (maximum 4 sentences), specific, and actionable.\n- For document content: maintain the original formatting intent (headings, lists, paragraphs).\n- No greeting or sign-off in comments.\n- Use the same register as the input — formal documents stay formal, casual notes stay casual.",
    "notion": "PLATFORM: Notion (page, database, or comment).\n\nADJUST:\n- Notion content varies widely: meeting notes, project specs, documentation, personal notes.\n- Preserve the original structure (headings, bullet points, checkboxes, tables).\n- If this is a comment, keep it concise (maximum 4 sentences).\n- For page content: maintain formatting intent and section structure.\n- No greeting or sign-off unless the input is a message-like block.",
    "jira": "PLATFORM: Jira (issue, comment, or description).\n\nADJUST:\n- Technical writing mode. Concise, specific, actionable.\n- Issue descriptions: clear problem statement, steps to reproduce (if bug), acceptance criteria (if story).\n- Comments: specific update, decision, or question. Maximum 4 sentences.\n- Use markdown formatting for structure where appropriate.\n- No greeting, no sign-off. Get to the point.",
    "github": "PLATFORM: GitHub (issue, PR comment, code review).\n\nADJUST:\n- Technical writing mode. Concise, specific, actionable.\n- Use markdown formatting if the input is structured (bullet points, headers).\n- Code references should use backtick formatting.\n- No greeting, no sign-off. Get to the point.\n- Maximum 6 sentences unless the input is a detailed spec.",
    "linkedin": "PLATFORM: LinkedIn message.\n\nADJUST:\n- Professional networking tone.\n- Keep it concise — LinkedIn messages that are too long don't get read.\n- Maximum 5 sentences.\n- If this is a connection request, it must be under 300 characters.",
    "chatgpt": "PLATFORM: AI chat (ChatGPT).\n\nThis is a prompt, not a message to a person. Apply the ai_prompt intent rules regardless of detected intent:\n- Structure as: Context → Task → Constraints → Expected output.\n- No greetings, no politeness, no sign-offs.\n- Be precise and unambiguous.",
    "claude": "PLATFORM: AI chat (Claude).\n\nThis is a prompt, not a message to a person. Apply the ai_prompt intent rules regardless of detected intent:\n- Structure as: Context → Task → Constraints → Expected output.\n- No greetings, no politeness, no sign-offs.\n- Be precise and unambiguous."
