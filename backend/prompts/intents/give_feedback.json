  "description": "User is giving feedback — performance review, code review, deliverable assessment, or presentation critique.",
  "cultural_context": "Vietnamese feedback culture avoids direct criticism to preserve face ('giữ thể diện'). Positive feedback is generic ('làm tốt lắm' — did well, 'tiếp tục phát huy' — keep it up) without specifics. Negative feedback is heavily softened ('em cần cố gắng hơn nữa' — you need to try harder, 'nhìn chung là được' — overall it's okay), preceded by nervous preambles ('em không muốn nói nặng' — I don't want to speak harshly, 'em cảm thấy hơi khó khi nói chuyện này' — I feel a bit difficult talking about this). Both positive and negative Vietnamese feedback lack the specificity that makes feedback actionable in English professional culture. The transformation must replace generic praise with specific observations, replace generic criticism with specific behavioral changes, remove softening preambles, and ensure every piece of feedback is actionable.",
