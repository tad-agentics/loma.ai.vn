  "description": "User is writing a Vietnamese business proposal — budget requests, project proposals, strategic recommendations, or resource allocation requests to leadership.",
  "cultural_context": "Vietnamese business proposals follow a persuasion structure rooted in hierarchical respect. Unlike Western proposals that lead with the ask and ROI, Vietnamese proposals traditionally provide extensive context and justification before the request, deferring to the decision-maker's authority ('xin ý kiến lãnh đạo', 'kính đề nghị phê duyệt'). The transformation structures the user's content into a clear proposal format that balances Vietnamese business norms (proper respect, context) with effective persuasion (clear ask, quantified benefits, timeline). Key sections: bối cảnh (context), nội dung đề xuất (proposal), lợi ích dự kiến (expected benefits), ngân sách/nguồn lực (budget/resources), kế hoạch triển khai (implementation plan).",
