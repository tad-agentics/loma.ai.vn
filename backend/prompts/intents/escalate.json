  "description": "User is escalating an issue to leadership — a blocker, SLA breach, cross-team dependency, or unresolved problem.",
  "cultural_context": "Escalation in Vietnamese culture is deeply uncomfortable. It is associated with 'mách' (tattling), 'làm lớn chuyện' (making a big deal), and violating group harmony. Vietnamese professionals preface escalations with extensive apologies and self-diminishing language: 'em không muốn làm lớn chuyện' (I don't want to make a big deal), 'em không muốn mách' (I don't want to tattle), 'em đã cố giải quyết nhưng vượt quá khả năng của em' (I tried to solve it but it's beyond my ability). They frame legitimate business escalations as personal failures. In English professional culture, escalation is a standard business tool — problem + impact + ask. The transformation must strip the guilt and self-blame, reframe scope as scope (not inability), and structure the escalation as a business problem requiring leadership input.",
  "tones": {
    "professional": "INTENT: Escalation to leadership.\n\nCULTURAL TRANSFORMATION:\n- Vietnamese: 'em không muốn làm lớn chuyện' (I don't want to make a big deal) → English: omit. If it needs escalation, escalate.\n- Vietnamese: 'em không muốn mách' (I don't want to tattle) → English: omit. Cross-team blockers are business problems, not personal complaints.\n- Vietnamese: 'vượt quá khả năng của em' (beyond my ability) → English: reframe as scope — 'this requires leadership input / cross-team alignment / budget authority', not inability.\n- Vietnamese: 'em sợ nếu không xử lý sớm' (I'm afraid if we don't handle this soon) → English: state the business impact directly with dates.\n- Vietnamese: vague urgency ('ảnh hưởng tới khách hàng') → English: quantified impact (SLA breach, revenue at risk, missed delivery date).\n\nTONE: Professional. Clear, factual, action-oriented. No guilt, no hedging.\n\nSTRUCTURE:\n- Sentence 1: The problem (what is blocked and for how long).\n- Sentence 2: Impact (timeline, customer, team, revenue affected).\n- Sentence 3: What you've tried (attempts to resolve).\n- Sentence 4: What you need (decision, resource, intervention).\n- Maximum 4-5 sentences.",
    "direct": "INTENT: Escalation.\n\nCULTURAL TRANSFORMATION:\n- Remove ALL preamble: 'không muốn làm lớn chuyện', 'không muốn mách', 'em sợ'.\n- Reframe 'vượt quá khả năng' as scope, not inability.\n- State problem, impact, ask. No emotional language.\n\nTONE: Direct. Facts only. No apologizing for escalating.\n\nSTRUCTURE:\n- Sentence 1: Problem.\n- Sentence 2: Impact with dates/numbers.\n- Sentence 3: What you need.\n- Maximum 3-4 sentences.",
    "warm": "INTENT: Escalation.\n\nCULTURAL TRANSFORMATION:\n- Replace guilt preambles with a brief collaborative framing.\n- 'Không muốn làm lớn chuyện' → 'Flagging this because I think we need your input.'\n- Keep the human tone but don't dilute the urgency.\n\nTONE: Warm. Collegial, solution-oriented. Frame as seeking help, not reporting failure. But still clear on the urgency and impact.\n\nSTRUCTURE:\n- Sentence 1: Brief framing (why you're escalating).\n- Sentence 2: The problem and its impact.\n- Sentence 3: What you've tried.\n- Sentence 4: What you need.\n- Maximum 4-5 sentences.",
    "formal": "INTENT: Escalation.\n\nCULTURAL TRANSFORMATION:\n- Vietnamese emotional escalation → English structured incident report.\n- Remove all self-diminishing language.\n- Quantify impact with dates, amounts, SLA metrics.\n\nTONE: Formal.
