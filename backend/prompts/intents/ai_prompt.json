  "description": "User is writing a prompt for an AI (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini) — code generation, analysis, content creation, or technical specs.",
  "cultural_context": "Vietnamese users commonly write prompts to AI chatbots using Vietnamese politeness conventions: kinship pronouns ('em muốn nhờ anh giúp' — I want to ask you to help me), hedging ('viết giúp em' — write for me), unnecessary greetings and sign-offs, and burying the actual task under context. Additionally, Vietnamese AI prompts mix Vietnamese and English heavily (code-switching), with technical terms in English embedded in Vietnamese sentences. The transformation must restructure the prompt into the Context → Task → Constraints → Expected output format that produces the best AI results, strip all politeness and greetings (AI doesn't need them), preserve every technical term exactly, and produce a clear, unambiguous prompt.",

    "professional": "INTENT: AI prompt optimization.\n\nCULTURAL TRANSFORMATION:\n- Vietnamese: 'em muốn nhờ anh viết giúp' (I want to ask you to help write) → English: 'Write [task].'\n- Vietnamese: 'viết giúp em' (write for me) → English: direct instruction.\n- Vietnamese: politeness to AI ('cảm ơn anh') → English: omit entirely. AI doesn't need thanks.\n- Vietnamese: greetings/sign-offs in AI prompts → English: omit. Wastes tokens.\n- Vietnamese: task buried in context → English: task first, context second.\n\nRETAIN: ALL technical terms exactly as written. Variable names, framework names, file formats, numbers, specifications — preserve verbatim.\n\nTONE: Direct, technical, unambiguous. An AI prompt is an instruction, not a conversation.\n\nSTRUCTURE:\n- Context (role, background, if needed).\n- Task (clear, specific instruction).\n- Constraints (length, format, style, edge cases).\n- Expected output format.\n- No greeting, no sign-off, no filler.",
    "direct": "INTENT: AI prompt optimization.\n\nCULTURAL TRANSFORMATION:\n- Strip ALL politeness: greetings, thanks, 'giúp em', 'nhờ anh'.\n- Restructure: Context → Task → Constraints → Output format.\n- Preserve every technical term verbatim.\n\nTONE: Maximum clarity, minimum words. Instruction, not conversation.\n\nSTRUCTURE:\n- Task (what to do).\n- Constraints (format, length, edge cases).\n- Expected output.\n- No filler.",
    "warm": "INTENT: AI prompt optimization.\n\nCULTURAL TRANSFORMATION:\n- Remove Vietnamese politeness rituals but allow a slightly conversational framing.\n- Still restructure into Context → Task → Constraints → Output.\n- Preserve all technical terms.\n\nTONE: Slightly conversational but still clear and structured. Appropriate for prompts that benefit from a collaborative tone (e.g., brainstorming, creative tasks).\n\nSTRUCTURE:\n- Brief context or role-setting.\n- Clear task description.\n- Constraints and expected output.\n- No greeting or sign-off.",
    "formal": "INTENT: AI prompt optimization.\n\nCULTURAL TRANSFORMATION:\n- Vietnamese formal AI prompt style → English structured specification.\n- Remove politeness. Preserve precision.\n- Preserve all technical terms verbatim.\n\nTONE: Formal, precise, specification-like. Suitable for complex technical prompts, multi-step instructions, or prompts that will be reused.\n\nSTRUCTURE:\n- Context and role definition.\n- Task specification with numbered requirements.\n- Constraints and edge cases.\n- Expected output format with examples if applicable."
