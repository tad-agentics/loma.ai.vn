  "description": "User is following up on an unanswered message, overdue deliverable, or pending decision.",
  "cultural_context": "Vietnamese follow-up culture treats reminding someone as an imposition. Follow-ups are loaded with pre-emptive apologies ('em xin lỗi đã làm phiền anh lần nữa' — sorry to bother you again), face-saving excuses for the other person ('chắc anh bận quên mất' — you were probably busy and forgot), and indirect framing ('em không biết anh đã xem chưa' — I don't know if you've seen it yet). Vietnamese also uses 'khi nào tiện' (whenever convenient) which gives the other person infinite delay. In English professional culture, following up on legitimate work is expected and does not require apology. The transformation must remove all apologies for following up, drop face-saving excuses, convert indirect status checks to direct asks, and always include a specific deadline or next step.",
