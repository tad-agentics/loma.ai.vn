  "name_en": "Decline",
  "description": "User is declining a request, pushing back on a deadline, or saying no to a partnership, vendor, or assignment.",
  "cultural_context": "Saying 'no' directly is one of the strongest taboos in Vietnamese professional culture. Vietnamese uses elaborate indirection: 'em nghĩ hơi khó' (I think it's a bit difficult), 'chắc là chưa phù hợp lắm' (probably not very suitable yet — triple hedge), 'để em suy nghĩ thêm rồi liên hệ lại sau' (let me think more and get back to you later — almost always means no). Vietnamese also justifies extensively before declining, burying the 'no' in the last sentence or leaving it implied entirely. Western recipients read these as 'maybe' or 'they're considering it,' which creates false expectations and follow-up loops. The transformation must make the 'no' explicit and early, provide a brief reason, optionally offer an alternative, and never leave the recipient wondering about the answer.",
  "tones": {
    "professional": "INTENT: Declining a request.\n\nCULTURAL TRANSFORMATION:\n- Vietnamese: 'em nghĩ hơi khó' (I think it's a bit difficult) → English: clear decline. 'Hơi khó' is Vietnamese soft no — say no.\n- Vietnamese: 'chắc là chưa phù hợp lắm' (probably not suitable yet) → English: 'This isn't the right fit for us right now.'\n- Vietnamese: 'để em suy nghĩ thêm rồi liên hệ lại sau' (let me think and get back to you) → English: if the answer is no, say no. If genuinely undecided, give a specific date.\n- Vietnamese: paragraphs of justification before the decline → English: decline first (sentence 1), reason second (sentence 2).\n- Vietnamese: 'em rất muốn giúp nhưng...' (I really want to help but...) → English: brief, clean decline without performing the desire to say yes.\n- Vietnamese: 'mong anh thông cảm' (hope you understand) → English: omit. No apology for having limits.\n\nTONE: Professional. Clear decline, brief reason, alternative if available. No apology for having boundaries.\n\nSTRUCTURE:\n- Sentence 1: Clear decline.\n- Sentence 2: Brief reason.\n- Sentence 3 (optional): Alternative or future opening (only if genuine).\n- Maximum 3 sentences.",
    "direct": "INTENT: Declining.\n\nCULTURAL TRANSFORMATION:\n- Remove ALL hedges: 'hơi khó', 'chưa phù hợp', 'suy nghĩ thêm', 'mong thông cảm'.\n- 'No' in the first sentence. Brief reason. Done.\n- If deferred, give a specific date — not 'later.'\n\nTONE: Direct. Clear, firm, no hedging. Respectful through brevity.\n\nSTRUCTURE:\n- Sentence 1: No.\n- Sentence 2: Reason.\n- Sentence 3 (optional): Alternative.\n- Maximum 2-3 sentences.",
    "warm": "INTENT: Declining.\n\nCULTURAL TRANSFORMATION:\n- Replace Vietnamese triple-hedge with a warm, honest decline.\n- 'Hơi khó' → 'I can't take this on right now, but here's what I'd suggest...'\n- Remove 'thông cảm' but keep genuine warmth and care for the relationship.\n\nTONE: Warm. Kind but clear. Decline with grace, not guilt. Maintain the relationship while being honest. Offer an alternative if possible.\n\nSTRUCTURE:\n- Sentence 1: Clear but warm decline.\n- Sentence 2: Brief reason (human, not corporate).\n- Sentence 3 (optional): Helpful alternative or future opening.\n- Maximum 3-4 sentences.",
    "formal": "INTENT: Declining.\n\nCULTURAL TRANSFORMATION:\n- Vietnamese indirect refusal → English formal, polite decline.\n- Replace hedging with composed, definitive language.\n- 'Chưa phù hợp' → 'We are unable to accommodate this request at this time.'\n\nTONE: Formal. Polite, composed, definitive. Suitable for vendor rejections, partnership declines, or official refusals. No contractions.\n\nSTRUCTURE:\n- Sentence 1: Brief appreciation (if appropriate).\n- Sentence 2: Clear, formal decline.\n- Sentence 3: Brief reason.\n- Sentence 4 (optional): Professional close or future opening.\n- Maximum 3-4 sentences."
