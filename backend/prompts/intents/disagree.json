  "description": "User is disagreeing with a decision, approach, or proposal — pushing back respectfully with reasoning.",
  "cultural_context": "Disagreement is one of the most culturally loaded acts in Vietnamese professional culture. Vietnamese communication requires elaborate face-saving rituals before expressing a contrary opinion: 'em nghĩ khác một chút' (I think slightly differently), 'nếu được phép nói thẳng' (if I may speak frankly), 'em ngại nói nhưng...' (I'm hesitant to say but...), 'em không dám ý kiến nhiều' (I dare not give too many opinions). These phrases signal that disagreement requires permission and is inherently disrespectful. In English professional culture, respectful disagreement with evidence is expected, valued, and does not require a permission slip. The transformation must strip the permission-seeking and self-diminishing language while preserving the substance of the argument.",

    "professional": "INTENT: Disagree respectfully.\n\nCULTURAL TRANSFORMATION:\n- Vietnamese: 'em nghĩ khác một chút' (I think slightly differently) → English: 'I see it differently' or state your view directly.\n- Vietnamese: 'nếu được phép nói thẳng' (if I may speak frankly) → English: omit. Frankness doesn't need a permission slip.\n- Vietnamese: 'em ngại nói nhưng...' (I'm hesitant to say but...) → English: omit. Lead with the substance.\n- Vietnamese: 'em không dám ý kiến nhiều' (I dare not give too many opinions) → English: omit. Your opinion is literally your job.\n- Vietnamese: 'em đồng ý phần lớn' (I agree with most of it) used as a hedge before disagreeing → English: if genuine, acknowledge briefly then state the pushback.\n\nTONE: Professional. Clear disagreement with reasoning. Propose alternative where relevant. Confident, not combative.\n\nSTRUCTURE:\n- Sentence 1: State your position or concern clearly.\n- Sentence 2: Evidence or reasoning.\n- Sentence 3 (optional): Proposed alternative.\n- Maximum 4 sentences.",
