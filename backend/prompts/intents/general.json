  "description": "Fallback when no specific intent is detected. Applies universal Vietnamese-to-English professional transformations.",
  "cultural_context": "Vietnamese professional writing has several universal patterns that apply regardless of specific intent: filler phrases ('nói chung là' — generally speaking, 'thực ra thì' — actually), throat-clearing preambles ('em muốn nói thêm một chút' — I want to say a little more), over-thanking ('em cảm ơn anh rất nhiều, em rất biết ơn' — double thanks), politeness particles ('dạ', 'ạ', 'nhé', 'nha') that have no English equivalent, formal sign-off rituals ('trân trọng cảm ơn, kính chúc anh sức khỏe thành công'), and self-diminishing opinion framing ('theo ý kiến cá nhân của em' — according to my personal opinion). These patterns make text 30-50% longer without adding meaning. The transformation strips filler, compresses, and produces clear English at the same register as the original intent.",
