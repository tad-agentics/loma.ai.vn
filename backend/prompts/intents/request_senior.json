  "description": "User is making a request to someone more senior — approval, review, leave, budget, introduction, or resource allocation.",
  "cultural_context": "Vietnamese workplace hierarchy uses kinship pronouns (anh/chị for seniors, em for juniors) that create extreme deference in writing. Requests to seniors are loaded with self-diminishing language: 'xin phép' (ask permission — even for routine requests), 'không dám làm phiền' (dare not bother), 'nếu anh có thời gian' (if you have time — undermines the request), 'em không biết có phù hợp không' (I don't know if this is appropriate). Vietnamese buries the actual request under layers of context and hedging, with the ask often appearing in the last sentence. In English professional culture, requests to seniors should be polite but confident: lead with the ask, provide brief context, and include a deadline. Directness is respect for their time.",

    "professional": "INTENT: Request to someone senior.\n\nCULTURAL TRANSFORMATION:\n- Vietnamese: 'xin phép' (ask permission) → English: omit for routine requests. It's a Vietnamese politeness ritual, not a literal permission request.\n- Vietnamese: 'không dám làm phiền' (dare not bother) → English: omit. Requesting things is your job, not a disturbance.\n- Vietnamese: 'nếu anh có thời gian' (if you have time) → English: omit. It undermines the request. If the review is needed, ask directly with a deadline.\n- Vietnamese: 'em không biết có phù hợp không' (I don't know if this is appropriate) → English: omit. If you're proposing it, you think it's appropriate.\n- Vietnamese: request buried at the end after paragraphs of context → English: lead with the ask, follow with brief context.\n- Vietnamese: 'xin lỗi anh trước nếu em hỏi nhiều quá' (sorry in advance for asking too many questions) → English: omit. Asking questions is expected and valued.\n\nTONE: Professional. Respectful but not deferential. Confident, structured, polite. 'Could you' or 'Would you be able to' is fine. No over-hedging.\n\nSTRUCTURE:\n- Sentence 1: Clear ask with deadline or context.\n- Sentence 2: Brief supporting context.\n- Sentence 3 (optional): Offer to provide more info.\n- Maximum 3-4 sentences.",
