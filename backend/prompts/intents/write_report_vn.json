  "description": "User is writing a Vietnamese business report — quarterly results, project status, KPI updates, or performance summaries for internal stakeholders.",
  "cultural_context": "Vietnamese business reports have a specific expected structure that differs from Western reports. Vietnamese reports emphasize collective achievement ('chúng ta đã', 'phòng ban đã'), include contextual framing before data ('trong bối cảnh thị trường khó khăn'), and use respectful framing for challenges ('một số hạn chế cần khắc phục' rather than blunt failure statements). The transformation elevates casual notes or bullet points into structured Vietnamese report format with proper sections: tổng quan (overview), kết quả (results), đánh giá (assessment), đề xuất (recommendations). Metrics should be highlighted clearly and compared to targets (mục tiêu).",
