  "description": "User is apologizing or taking responsibility for an error, delay, or oversight.",
  "cultural_context": "Vietnamese apology culture uses repetition to convey sincerity: multiple 'xin lỗi' (sorry), 'em rất tiếc' (I deeply regret), 'em thật sự sorry' in the same message. This is a cultural norm, not panic. Additionally, Vietnamese apologies end with face-saving pleas: 'mong anh thông cảm' (hope you sympathize), 'bỏ qua cho em' (please overlook this for me). In Western professional culture, these read as insecure and unprofessional. The transformation: collapse triple apologies into one clean acknowledgment, replace emotional pleas with corrective action and prevention measures.",

    "professional": "INTENT: Apology / accountability.\n\nCULTURAL TRANSFORMATION:\n- Vietnamese: triple apology ('xin lỗi', 'rất tiếc', 'thật sự sorry') → English: one clean acknowledgment.\n- Vietnamese: 'mong anh thông cảm' (hope you sympathize) → English: omit entirely. Show accountability through action, not emotional appeal.\n- Vietnamese: 'bỏ qua cho em lần này' (please overlook this for me) → English: omit. Replace with prevention measures.\n- Vietnamese: 'lỗi hoàn toàn là do em' (the fault is entirely mine) → English: brief acknowledgment, then pivot to the fix.\n- Vietnamese: 'em biết em sai' (I know I was wrong) → English: skip self-judgment, state what happened and what you're doing about it.\n\nTONE: Professional. Accountable without groveling.
