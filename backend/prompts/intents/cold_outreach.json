  "name_en": "Cold outreach",
  "description": "User is reaching out to someone they don't know — networking, sales, partnership proposals, or event invitations.",
  "cultural_context": "Vietnamese cold outreach follows a rigid cultural template: long formal self-introduction (name, title, company history, years of experience), generic admiration ('rất ngưỡng mộ công việc của anh'), then the ask buried at the end. This creates emails that are 3x too long and sound like spam in English. Western professional outreach leads with a hook (why the recipient should care), compresses credentials into one line of social proof, and ends with a specific low-friction ask. Vietnamese also uses formal template language ('kính gửi quý khách hàng', 'trân trọng giới thiệu') that triggers spam filters in English.",
  "tones": {
    "professional": "INTENT: Cold outreach.\n\nCULTURAL TRANSFORMATION:\n- Vietnamese: company biography opener ('thành lập năm 2018, chuyên về...') → English: one-line credentials as proof, not opener.\n- Vietnamese: generic admiration ('rất ngưỡng mộ công việc của anh') → English: specific reference to their work ('your talk at X', 'your article about Y').\n- Vietnamese: formal template language ('kính gửi quý khách hàng', 'trân trọng giới thiệu') → English: omit entirely — this is spam trigger language.\n- Vietnamese: ask buried at the end → English: lead with hook, close with specific ask.\n- Vietnamese: 'mong nhận được phản hồi sớm' (hope to receive early response) → English: specific next step ('Would a 15-minute call next week work?').\n\nTONE: Professional. Concise, compelling, specific. One value prop, one ask.\n\nSTRUCTURE:\n- Sentence 1: Hook — why you're writing and why they should care.\n- Sentence 2: One line of social proof or credibility.\n- Sentence 3: Specific, low-friction ask (15-min call, reply, connection).\n- Maximum 4-5 sentences.",
    "direct": "INTENT: Cold outreach.\n\nCULTURAL TRANSFORMATION:\n- Remove ALL preamble: company history, formal introductions, generic praise.\n- Lead with why you're writing in the first sentence.\n- Vietnamese 'tự giới thiệu' (self-introduction) ritual → skip to the point.\n- End with a specific ask, not a vague hope.\n\nTONE: Direct. No fluff. Why you, why them, what's the ask. Every word earns its place.\n\nSTRUCTURE:\n- Sentence 1: Why you're reaching out (reference something specific about them).\n- Sentence 2: What you bring (one sentence max).\n- Sentence 3: The ask.\n- Maximum 3-4 sentences.",
    "warm": "INTENT: Cold outreach.\n\nCULTURAL TRANSFORMATION:\n- Replace generic Vietnamese admiration with a genuine, specific compliment.\n- Company biography → brief, human context about what you do.\n- Formal closings → friendly, low-pressure ask.\n\nTONE: Warm. Conversational, personable, genuine. Like a colleague introducing themselves at a conference. Not salesy.\n\nSTRUCTURE:\n- Sentence 1: Warm, specific hook (reference their work, a mutual connection, or a shared interest).\n- Sentence 2: Brief intro — who you are and what you do (one sentence).\n- Sentence 3: Why you think there's a fit.\n- Sentence 4: Friendly, low-pressure ask.\n- Maximum 5 sentences.",
    "formal": "INTENT: Cold outreach.\n\nCULTURAL TRANSFORMATION:\n- Vietnamese formal template ('kính gửi', 'trân trọng') → English formal business style (not Vietnamese formal style).\n- Company credentials → structured, concise social proof.\n- Generic asks → specific, professional proposal.\n\nTONE: Formal. Business correspondence quality. Suitable for C-suite, procurement, or institutional contacts. No contractions, no casual language.\n\nSTRUCTURE:\n- Sentence 1: Purpose of the outreach.\n- Sentence 2-3: Brief credentials and relevance to them.\n- Sentence 4: Specific, professional ask or proposed next step.\n- Maximum 5 sentences."
