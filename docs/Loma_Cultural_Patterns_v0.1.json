I'd like to discuss [topic].","context":"Requesting an introduction","notes":"Vietnamese buries the purpose.

Payment is due by [date].","context":"Resending invoice with polite but firm deadline","notes":"'Giúp em nha' (help me, okay?) frames payment as a favor.

Can we finalize by [date]?","context":"Explaining urgency without begging, code-switched","notes":"State the business impact without the emotional plea. 'Thông cảm' (sympathize) is too personal for business.","code_switched":true},{"id":"payment_008","category":"ask_payment","vietnamese_pattern":"Dạ em chào anh, em từ bộ phận kế toán công ty [company], em liên hệ về vấn đề thanh toán hóa đơn...","typical_translation":"Hello, I am from the accounting department of [company], I am contacting regarding the issue of invoice payment...","loma_mapping":"Hi [name], reaching out from [company]'s finance team about outstanding invoice #[number].","context":"First contact from accounting, formal","notes":"Vietnamese formal self-introduction from accounting.

Em cần submit cho client trước deadline","typical_translation":"The proposal I sent last week, have you reviewed it? I need to submit to client before deadline","loma_mapping":"Checking in on the proposal I sent last week. I need to submit to the client by [deadline] — could you review by [date]?","context":"Follow-up with deadline pressure, code-switched","notes":"Preserve 'proposal', 'review', 'submit', 'client', 'deadline'. Add specific dates.","code_switched":true},{"id":"followup_004","category":"follow_up","vietnamese_pattern":"Em nhắc nhẹ anh về cái việc hôm bữa mình nói...","typical_translation":"I gently remind you about the thing we talked about the other day...","loma_mapping":"Quick reminder about [specific topic] we discussed on [date]. What's the status?","context":"Gentle reminder about a discussed item","notes":"'Nhắc nhẹ' (gently remind) is unnecessary softening.

Here's why: [reason].","context":"Declining a proposal or idea","notes":"'Hơi khó' (a bit difficult) is Vietnamese soft no. The listener is supposed to infer the refusal.

I'll have to pass this time, but I'd be open to future opportunities.","context":"Declining an invitation or opportunity","notes":"The Vietnamese version is close to good English.

Could we revisit this next [month/quarter]?","context":"Declining extra work, code-switched","notes":"Preserve 'appreciate', 'offer', 'workload', 'overload'. 'At capacity' is the professional English equivalent.","code_switched":true},{"id":"sayno_010","category":"say_no","vietnamese_pattern":"Cái này không thuộc scope công việc của em, em không chắc mình nên làm...","typical_translation":"This is not within the scope of my work, I'm not sure I should do it...","loma_mapping":"This falls outside my current scope.

Xin chân thành cảm ơn.","typical_translation":"I look forward to receiving your early response. Sincerely thank you.","loma_mapping":"Would [specific next step] work for you?","context":"Closing a cold outreach message","notes":"Vietnamese formal closing is too stiff.
